        <title>The End of this Road</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will probably be my last post here for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having plenty of time in the past months to make this decision, I’ve chosen to stop the development of my game (AKA Multivrs). Here are some of the reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-a-game-alone-is-really-hard&quot;&gt;Making a game alone is REALLY hard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a pretty competent and self-sufficient developer. I can make decent 3d models, write functional code and I know my way around a game engine. What is not really possible to do alone is to challenge your ideas and have other points of view about the best way to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is plenty of brave game dev who managed to work on their project alone during multiple years. But I would argue that most of them are probably not as isolated as I am. In most mid-sized cities, there’s plenty of gaming events to showcase your work, a community of developers and reliable access to the internet. None of those things are available in Kuujjuaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-games-not-fun&quot;&gt;The game’s not fun&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I no longer believe in the direction the game is heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from the beginning that it was a pretty risky bet considering the experimental nature of the game. I still think a lot of its components are interesting and maybe at some point in the future I will find a way to salvage most of it. But at the current stage, I can’t see how I’m gonna be able to make it fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was still a lot of work remaining but most of the gameplay ingredients were done. So it would have made no sense to put maybe an another year on polishing something I no longer feel is really good. Time is too important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;FIN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all of this does not sound too depressing. Because in the end, I’m really glad I made that decision about a year ago to quit my job and start working on my own game. It was the right choice and I don’t regret it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a much better developer right now than when I started this. I learned a crazy amount of new stuff, managed to get really good in all things related to procedural generation, overcame my fear of math and did some nice art pieces along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for tuning in! This blog will now go in hibernation until some other weird idea takes over.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Step lightly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s something else to know about the dangers lurking in the Multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;entropy-bubbles&quot;&gt;Entropy bubbles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes peeled when running around looking for the Prey because if not careful, you might accidentally enter an entropy bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are scattered across the surface and do a great deal of damage to the Hunter. Some equipment will help to see them clearly but without it, the only way to see them is to cautiously look out for a small air refraction around the bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what stepping on them looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEhn9KniOuOi77SrC/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; style=&quot;min-height:320px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like you can see from the screenshot above, the entropy bubbles are done. They are spawned randomly on the ground and I’m pleased with the explosion effect. The weird black structure/dust is made with a raymarching shader applied on a 2d billboard so no textures are involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apart from that, I made a couple of experiments mostly for fun and invested some time on my Houdini skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I will be taking another long vacation! (what a loafer…) I might be back in Kuujjuaq around early October. The plan is to make a very long road trip across North America. I still want to work a little bit on the game during that time but I will be armed only with a notebook and a pen. However since I need to do some writing for the character, setting and “story”, this will be a good excuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When in doubt, make a new Universe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be a quick update considering it’s only been one week since I’m back at work in Kuujjuaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit rusty so I decided to do something fun to get me started: creating a new Universe. It’s really not what I should be doing but what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the procedural power of Houdini, I made a simulation of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/YMpSbp&quot;&gt;Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction&lt;/a&gt;. For any non-chemistry geek out there, it’s something known as a chemical oscillator that is developing nice patterns over time. Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/l3JDlKODwyrvP3svm/giphy.gif&quot;&gt;this gif&lt;/a&gt; of the reaction process in Houdini!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have the general mood of this Universe but I still want to work more on it later. Maybe adding weird slimy particle effects and/or big toxic-looking shapes in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ssbRTfn.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step will be polishing the hunt gameplay and adding some danger to the worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mind-bending the Multiverse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I talked about how carrying an equipment will give the player some special abilities when they are in a Shelter. Well, that mechanic is now finally added to the game. Before the usual update notes, here’s some more info on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;altering-the-environment&quot;&gt;Altering the environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each equipment in the game will provide a unique power to modify the Multiverse. This could be simple things like improving the odds of finding Spotters, reducing the wind speed or a huge transformation like spawning a Portal where you want it. This is achieved by activating the equipment when in a Shelter and then selecting the Hex tiles that you want to affect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to know is that every modification that you do to an Hex tile will be applied to all the Universe at the same time. This means it could affect the Prey no matter in which Universe it is located. As Frank Underwood said: “If you don’t like how the table is set, turn over the table.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As you can see in the screenshot bellow, a lot of effort in the past weeks have been put on the menu that appears when the Hunter is in a Shelter. Most of the features are now fully functional, with proper player feedback and visual effects. The biggest addition is the Gear Ability action as discussed in the previous section. Apart from that, there is now a tooltip text when hovering on the buttons and a new feature to set a waypoint on an Hex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/oWkfePl.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regarding the Shelter, I developed a system to keep track of time and be able to fast forward. This is mostly relevant to the Shelter actions because the drawback of using them is that the Hunter looses some time. A side note on this: it was much more complex to create a smooth fast forward than I would have thought. I had to create a function to find the integral of a curve and for someone who failed 2 times his college maths, that was a big achievement!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The camera behaviour has been modified when approaching large structure like a Portal or a Shelter. The camera now zooms out and stay fixed on the Hunter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 4.16 integration is now done. A couple of nice new features that comes with it will be useful in the near future like Volumetric fog, String data tables and the new cloth solver NvCloth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve put more love on the art for the Prey but I’m still not satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, I managed to get some nice looking wind in there without having suck-ass performances. Check it out below. This is created by simulating the wind in Houdini and extorting procedurally created triangle strips. The mesh is big but only about 7500 vertex. I then applied a pretty simple Material on it that animate along the UVs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iyje7eObzyjfOak/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;wind&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdYFyl6ji2jWGly/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;wind2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taking-a-break&quot;&gt;Taking a break&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not be working on the game for the next 3 and a half weeks as I will be travelling down “south” (AKA Quebec city). After 7 months in Nunavik, I will take a bit of time off to see family and friends and enjoy the luxury of having more than 5 choices of overpriced crappy beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trigger happy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, I’m asking for feedback again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a link to download Version 0.4 of the game. A lot of things have been added to it since the last version so I encourage anyone to download and try it, even those of you who played a previous version. In this one, it’s actually possible to win! What a time to be alive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/vs7TrXD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here’s what I’ve worked on since the last post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The way the Prey moves is now vastly improved. It’s now kind of flying/hovering instead of walking and is much more predictable. No more getting stuck in obstacles! Although it is possible the Prey will fly upward indefinitely so… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking of which, I’ve started working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdRrSfss011lCJW/giphy.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;visuals for the Prey&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, there’s only the head without the rest of the body but I think it’s beginning to look nice. There’s still a lot to do however: rigging/skinning, animations, FX, … The reason I’m releasing it even if it’s not finished yet is that I’m waiting for the release of Unreal Engine 4.16, which will add a new cloth physics solver. Since I plan to make the Prey’s body mostly with cloth, I’ll wait a bit so I won’t have to do the work twice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of effort has been put on a tech to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aLMBCSUWfjA7Oo/giphy.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nice wind trails&lt;/a&gt;. The results are interesting but unfortunately it is very ressource intensive. Because of that, I’m not sure if I will continue to work on it or find a new way to do it. It would be a shame to trash it because the tech is nifty. It involves creating a wind simulation in Houdini, exporting a custom file format with Python, reading the custom file in Unreal with C++ and creating splines at runtime that are followed by trail emitters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Shelter menu was in need of an overhaul so I changed its whole look. It’s now closer to the rest of the UI Art direction but a lot of features are missing. For this version, the only thing available is the Rest option although it shouldn’t be an issue to play the game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An finally, a lot of bugs have been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;version-04&quot;&gt;Version 0.4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the download link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-info&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B69VFxUQ_NcuVWNJdDBzanV0Snc/view?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
  Multivrs v0.4
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few small notes regarding this version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the text bubbles! Normally, all the necessary information to play the game will be displayed via text in the upper left corner. Right now, it’s not possible to read the text again when it’s gone so if you missed something, the only way to see it again will be to close and start the game again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obviously, the balancing is not done so it’s kind of easy right now. This does not mean that you cannot die so you should keep an eye on your health. Everything will be very different once all the features and content are in place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please take a few seconds to respond to &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/P3rA2P32F29IUVI03&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this small survey&lt;/a&gt;! Any feedback is welcome and much appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tightening up the graphics on level 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been another long month since the last update so it’s about time I give some news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last weeks have been going on smoothly. There’s not a lot of big improvements but a couple of nice ones. I’m inching slowly but steadily towards the next release. If everything goes right, I might be able to have the next version in a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the usual update notes, here’s some info about the final steps of the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pulling-the-trigger&quot;&gt;Pulling the trigger&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s say you managed to track down a multi-dimensional being. Will you be able to kill it without fucking it up? Well, pay attention. Here’s how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, you need to know a very important characteristic of the Prey. Even if it leaves a trace in all Universes at the same time, its “soul” resides in only one of them. If you are not in the correct Universe, you will only be able to see the ethereal shape of the Prey, a sort of shadow across the Multiverse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However, even though it won’t kill it, you should still try to shoot and hit the Prey. The Hunter carries a strange and powerful weapon that can tear up a fragment of the Prey through multiple dimensions. By picking this piece of the target, you will be able to know in which Universe the “soul” of the Prey is currently located.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With this information in hand, you now know where to go next. You still need to hurry, not only because the Multiverse is a perilous place but also because the Prey might try to switch to an other Universe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, be cautious when approaching the Prey! Simply with its presence, it’s disturbing the space-time around itself! As you get closer to the target, you will experience a slow down of time and the environment will be much more harmful to the Hunter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it! I will not spoil the awesome and &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/11CCn8sSFSm2kg/giphy.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already planned&lt;/a&gt; ending so you will have to play to see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New screenshot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/aLIZiw1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I modified (again) the system to manage the ambience (lighting, fog, post-process, …). It’s now much more convenient and predictable and can eventually support multiple ambiences for the same environment. I have used this to changed the whole look of the very first Universe I created (as you can see in the screenshot).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also in the image above is the new User Interface! I will use these sort of floating texts to display most of the information the player needs. The system is flexible and I’m truly pleased with it! Of course, it looks better in action (note to self: make gifs next time).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking of UI, I implemented a pretty basic Main menu. Still needs a lot of love in there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In terms of actual gameplay, almost all the steps I talked about in the previous section are now in place. I have added the sort of space-time disruption around the Prey as well as the fragment that is detached when you hit the target. Of course, I need to work more on this gameplay loop but it’s starting to take shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWvfMLl4ho&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Back to finishing level 3 and tightening up the graphics!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Failing successfully</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So in the past couple of weeks, not a lot of progress has been done. I have been bogged down in details, I trashed some concepts, introduced ugly bugs… I also possibly lost 2 weeks on a big change to the main character (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;Progress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Dft6oMW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most significant achievement is making the system to switch between Universes. I have a basic template for the Portals. Aside from a cool effect in the center of them (see screenshot), everything is pretty rough. All of this still a lot of love to make it good-looking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have worked on some boring stuff under the hood to make the transition from one Universe to another happen without any bugs (fun times).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ok so I had this great idea for the Hunter: what if he was piloting some sort of hovercraft? He would be skimming across the surface, his equipment strapped to the vehicle and the antenna pointing toward the location of the Prey. So I made it. You can see what it looks like in the screenshot above. It took me two weeks to do it, including the modelling and some animations and effects. It’s also a completely new control scheme. The result are very underwhelming. It’s not bad but it doesn’t really solve all the problems like I was hopping. So I’m putting this on hold. I will come back to it in maybe 2 weeks and decide if I trash it completely or work more on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m taking next week off to go running around in the snow and sleeping in shelters. This will be a well needed break away from the Multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There shall be bugs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m one (big) step closer to a real game! Below you will find the link for &lt;strong&gt;version 0.3&lt;/strong&gt; of the game but first, here’s what’s been happening during the last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Peud5QF.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first very obvious change is the new environment (one more universe in the multiverse). Why waste some precious time in adding this instead of finishing important features? Well the &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; reason is I needed a more complex environment to test the Prey movements. However, the &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; reason is I was getting bored with the last universe. Making the new one was a lot of fun and I’m really pleased with the result (poke me if you are interested in the details).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The big new feature is the addition of the Prey and with it, a real goal for the player. It’s still very basic for now and the AI is completely dumb. There’s no interaction with the Hunter and there’s currently nothing to do when you find it. Still, it can be kind of fun to try to locate it but I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be biased.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost all of the tools for finding the Prey are functional. It is possible it will not be enough in the final game but I think it may be just a matter of tweaking the availability of those tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve worked on the Shelters again, changing the visuals and finishing the features. It looks a lot more weird now but I kind of like it. Of course, this will continue to change as I polish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, I plan on working on the actual hunt gameplay as well as the shift between the universes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;version-03&quot;&gt;Version 0.3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the link to download the latest build:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-info&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B69VFxUQ_NcuOEU2ajNTVzd1TTg/view?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
  Multivrs v0.3
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want missing features? I got you covered. Some confusing gameplay with no help text? Say no more. Maybe a couple of game-breaking bugs? Of course! But before sending you into the unknown, there are some important things I need to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the controls. I strongly suggest playing with keyboard and mouse this time since the gamepad is not supported in the menus. Here’s the keys you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse&lt;/strong&gt; to move the camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WASD&lt;/strong&gt; to move the Hunter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spacebar&lt;/strong&gt; to jump (holding it will make you jump higher)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; to pickup gear and enter Shelters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tab&lt;/strong&gt; to show the map&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; to use Location(x) and Momentum(p) Spotter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esc&lt;/strong&gt; to pause and exit the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the actual gameplay. There is no score, time or death right now (although there is a Health stat). You can freely go anywhere and do anything but if you would like to find the Prey, here’s some hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are very far from the start location, just restart the game. There is a known issue with the Prey if you are too far away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collecting the Location (x) and Momentum (p) Spotters will help you know informations about the Prey, respectively it’s current position and direction of travel. These infos will be displayed on the map once you use Spotters and will stay there for about 1 min.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entering Shelters will give you access to some special actions. You will be able to locate the nearest gear but more importantly, you can make a Location or Momentum scan without using any Spotters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 3D model for the Prey is really just a placeholder. I still haven’t figure out what it will look like in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope all of this is not too confusing. There’s still a lot of work to do on feedback and clarity. Speaking of which, I would really appreciate any comments you might have on the current state of the game. Please take a minute or two to answer these &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/HZk4cdwARNKpraMp1&quot;&gt;few questions&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, you can also just leave a comment below or on the Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>There's no place like (a multi-dimensional) home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a very quick update so I’ll try to keep this short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shelters-and-entropy&quot;&gt;Shelters and Entropy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let me briefly explain the goal of the feature I’ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling through the multiverse is &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.giphy.com/26xBx2btTgloCnStW.gif&quot;&gt;not only exhausting&lt;/a&gt; for the Hunter but it can also be very harmful to him. Each universe has a different &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_entropy&quot;&gt;level of entropy&lt;/a&gt; and the higher this is, the more damage is dealt to the player over time. This will require the Hunter to find and rest at specific places called Shelters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they will not only be important for regaining health. Shelters give access to special abilities to help you find the Prey or have a strategic advantage over it. For example, you can locate the nearest equipment or portal, possibly helping you get back on track. Additionally, each equipment will have unique powers that are only accessible there. The drawback of using any Shelter abilities is the loss of time. This means that the longer you stay in there, the farther the Prey is moving away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;Progress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New stuff! You can see in the screenshot a first draft for the HUD, the map overlay and a placeholder Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OvPJ4qD.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So the map is (mostly) done. The icons are temporary and it’s very simple but everything is functional. As a side note, instead of using images to make the UI, I have created a custom font as a way to have vector files in Unreal Engine. This allows me to resize the UI without worrying about the resolution and it also has a much smaller memory footprint. It’s a little bit hackish but awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The shelters are about 50% done. I’m kind of blocked by the other missing features now so I’ll stop for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is a big one: actually creating the Prey. I know I should have done this much sooner but there’s no running away now. There’s a lot of stuff to do here: creating a basic AI that is moving through a dynamically generated environment as well as taking decisions based on the player location and the features of the hex map. Oh, and also shifting through multiple Universes. You know, basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on releasing a build when I have something somewhat functional. I can’t wait for this because there will be an actual goal this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This is getting interesting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy new cosmic cycle everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you 31,536,000 seconds of awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a big thank you to everyone that took the time to download, play and answer the survey for the first build. This means a lot to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-prey&quot;&gt;Finding the Prey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, the ultimate goal of this game is about hunting down a Prey (real name TBD). The only &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; issue here is that you’re in an infinite Multiverse. Meaning: endless parallel Universes. Shit’s big yo! Good luck finding the only living thing other than yourself! Because this could get boring pretty fast, you will be able to learn information about the Prey’s current position by collecting special items called Spotters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists 2 different types of these: Location and Momentum. The first gives you the current position of the Prey and with the second you learn its momentum (or current direction). Brainy readers among us may now have realized that this is a direct reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle&quot;&gt;Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;. This is a good indication that you can expect this game concept to go full on nerd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-so-far&quot;&gt;Progress so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the stuff that no longer gives me headaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Masterplan&lt;/em&gt; is done. I was working on this for a looonng time and I can now say with some relief that I finally have the big picture figured out. This includes the complete set of features for version 1.0 (or Alpha or whatever you want to call it). Of course some things will still change along the journey but at least I know where I’m headed. Here’s a draft version for the One Pager that is still WIP. I will not explain it right now but I couldn’t wait to share a glimpse it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xL1bk9O.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have now put in place the system for picking up equipment and items. Aside from the Spotters mentioned above, you can grab equipment that will give you abilities as long as you possess them. For now, only 2 of those are functional but I plan on creating a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; more. I will go into more details about the equipment some other time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A very simple HUD is now displayed. There is information about the current equipment, Spotters, and Health of the character. I want to keep things minimalist so there may already be too much information but it’s also kind of useful to have. We’ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freshly added is the map view, an overlay where the hexagon map and your progress is displayed. The map gets bigger as you travel in the world and some hexagon tiles have special icons to indicate points of interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps are first to finish the map view by squashing the bugs and second adding the Shelters. These will be places where the character will have to rest in order to recover from the hostile environment. It will also be a place to use special abilities and plan your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay awesome folks!&lt;/p&gt;
