        <title>There's no place like (a multi-dimensional) home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a very quick update so I’ll try to keep this short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shelters-and-entropy&quot;&gt;Shelters and Entropy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let me briefly explain the goal of the feature I’ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling through the multiverse is &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.giphy.com/26xBx2btTgloCnStW.gif&quot;&gt;not only exhausting&lt;/a&gt; for the Hunter but it can also be very harmful to him. Each universe has a different &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_entropy&quot;&gt;level of entropy&lt;/a&gt; and the higher this is, the more damage is dealt to the player over time. This will require the Hunter to find and rest at specific places called Shelters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they will not only be important for regaining health. Shelters give access to special abilities to help you find the Prey or have a strategic advantage over it. For example, you can locate the nearest equipment or portal, possibly helping you get back on track. Additionally, each equipment will have unique powers that are only accessible there. The drawback of using any Shelter abilities is the loss of time. This means that the longer you stay in there, the farther the Prey is moving away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;Progress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New stuff! You can see in the screenshot a first draft for the HUD, the map overlay and a placeholder Shelter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/OvPJ4qD.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So the map is (mostly) done. The icons are temporary and it’s very simple but everything is functional. As a side note, instead of using images to make the UI, I have created a custom font as a way to have vector files in Unreal Engine. This allows me to resize the UI without worrying about the resolution and it also has a much smaller memory footprint. It’s a little bit hackish but awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The shelters are about 50% done. I’m kind of blocked by the other missing features now so I’ll stop for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is a big one: actually creating the Prey. I know I should have done this much sooner but there’s no running away now. There’s a lot of stuff to do here: creating a basic AI that is moving through a dynamically generated environment as well as taking decisions based on the player location and the features of the hex map. Oh, and also shifting through multiple Universes. You know, basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on releasing a build when I have something somewhat functional. I can’t wait for this because there will be an actual goal this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep it cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This is getting interesting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy new cosmic cycle everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you 31,536,000 seconds of awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a big thank you to everyone that took the time to download, play and answer the survey for the first build. This means a lot to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-prey&quot;&gt;Finding the Prey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, the ultimate goal of this game is about hunting down a Prey (real name TBD). The only &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; issue here is that you’re in an infinite Multiverse. Meaning: endless parallel Universes. Shit’s big yo! Good luck finding the only living thing other than yourself! Because this could get boring pretty fast, you will be able to learn information about the Prey’s current position by collecting special items called Spotters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists 2 different types of these: Location and Momentum. The first gives you the current position of the Prey and with the second you learn its momentum (or current direction). Brainy readers among us may now have realized that this is a direct reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle&quot;&gt;Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle&lt;/a&gt;. This is a good indication that you can expect this game concept to go full on nerd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-so-far&quot;&gt;Progress so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the stuff that no longer gives me headaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Masterplan&lt;/em&gt; is done. I was working on this for a looonng time and I can now say with some relief that I finally have the big picture figured out. This includes the complete set of features for version 1.0 (or Alpha or whatever you want to call it). Of course some things will still change along the journey but at least I know where I’m headed. Here’s a draft version for the One Pager that is still WIP. I will not explain it right now but I couldn’t wait to share a glimpse it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xL1bk9O.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have now put in place the system for picking up equipment and items. Aside from the Spotters mentioned above, you can grab equipment that will give you abilities as long as you possess them. For now, only 2 of those are functional but I plan on creating a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; more. I will go into more details about the equipment some other time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A very simple HUD is now displayed. There is information about the current equipment, Spotters, and Health of the character. I want to keep things minimalist so there may already be too much information but it’s also kind of useful to have. We’ll see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freshly added is the map view, an overlay where the hexagon map and your progress is displayed. The map gets bigger as you travel in the world and some hexagon tiles have special icons to indicate points of interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps are first to finish the map view by squashing the bugs and second adding the Shelters. These will be places where the character will have to rest in order to recover from the hostile environment. It will also be a place to use special abilities and plan your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay awesome folks!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First &amp;quot;playable&amp;quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok so that took longer than expected! Not only did I stray a little bit too far from the main path, but I also had a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of troubles packaging an executable. Long story short: I had to re-download Unreal Engine completely (fun times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-so-far&quot;&gt;Progress so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/1O47mzF.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; style=&quot;max-height:500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since last update, I managed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a main character. Of course, he’s mostly a placeholder currently but I probably want to stay in this direction. I’ll try a couple of different style and models in the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement a basic control scheme. Apart from the main character’s movement, there is a couple of small details in there to make it “feel” right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modify the environment a little. I’m not really satisfied with it yet, so I’ll probably need to come up with some other solutions, mostly for managing the colours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a pause menu. It was kind of bad that the only way to exit the game was to Alt+F4 it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next goal will be to finally finish the design document and to add some real gameplay in there. I’ve been refining my thoughts on the design elements recently and trying to come up with something that &lt;em&gt;in theory&lt;/em&gt; will be a great game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-playable-build&quot;&gt;First playable build&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like promised, I am now able to share the current state of the game! Here’s the download link for version 0.2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-info&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;amp;id=0B69VFxUQ_NcubTkzOGtoR1o5ZVk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
  Multivrs v0.2
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It supports keyboard + mouse inputs as well as gamepads. The controls should be pretty simple to figure out for anyone who has played a videogame in the last decade. Not much to do in the game right now but hey, you can always make “Pew Pew” sounds with your mouth and imagine shooting lasers at aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One really useful thing you can do is answering this &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/7yedkmnDzgnU2UkM2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;short survey&lt;/a&gt;. I would be eternally grateful for any early feedback that you can give me. You can also leave a comment or question below if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Baby steps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished the first “real” full-time work week for the game. Here’s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-grid&quot;&gt;The Grid&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a bit more info on a crucial element of the game: I have decided to use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hex grid&lt;/a&gt; for the game “board”. It’s normally exclusive to strategy games (think Civ or Catan) but this will serve 3 important purposes in my case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help create a modular system for the game assets, especially everything related to the terrain. This will be way better than having to create manually a terrain that is limited in it’s size (for manpower and memory reasons), or coming up with big world generator (Notch was not available since he’s busy writing shitty tweets).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve as a foundation to design the strategic elements of the game. Some hexagon tiles will influence the gameplay in specific ways and inversely the player will have abilities that can affect the tiles. Most of these features will be managed in a “map view” where the grid will be pretty obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hex grids make everything awesome!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-so-far&quot;&gt;Progress so far&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First screenshot! Whooo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/vrlcPJh.png&quot; alt=&quot;screenshot&quot; title=&quot;progress screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what has been achieve this week :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data structure that describes the properties of a univers (or level if you want). It’s pretty basic for now but it can be easily expanded in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using this data, I can spawn an environment that endlessly grows as the player moves. The look and gameplay elements are also setup automatically by the data structure and can be switched easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; basic terrain, that is functional but really ugly. It served mostly as a workbench to test the modular approach to the ground creation and I’m happy to have a result that is mostly seamless (transition between hexagon tiles are almost hidden).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to implement the first iteration of the 3Cs (Character, Camera and Controls). I estimate it will take me at least another week to have something decent. After this is done, I will probably be ready to share the first build of the “game”. Of course, it will be very bare bones with nothing to do but running endlessly in an unattractive desert. Exciting no? Don’t worry, I’ll let you know when it’s ready so you’ll be able to tell me how much it’s disappointing ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyberspace-of-the-north&quot;&gt;Cyberspace of the North&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet access is only possible with satellites in Kuujjuaq. As you may guess, this means that it’s expensive and the quality depends on a lot of factors (whether there’s a lot of people using it at the same time or if it snowed on the satellite dish). Normally, the download speed is “ok” (average of 0.8 Mb/s) but the latency is really high (about 600ms). Here’s what &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.speedtest.net/result/5831645979&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a typical connection looks like&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, it can be really frustrating when it slows down to a crawl but I just have to be patient and remind myself that my Google search result for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/search?q=raccoon+stealing+cat+food&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raccoon stealing cat food&lt;/a&gt;” is coming from &lt;strong&gt;fucking space!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Here's the plan...</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m making a game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimated current progress = &lt;strong&gt;1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda know what I want to make but have no idea what it will become. The current goal is to have a functional prototype as quickly as possible. I intend on being pretty open about the development of this game. There will be good fortunes and mishaps along the way and provided they are not too embarrassing, I will share them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh! also, there is no official title for now (&lt;strong&gt;TO DO&lt;/strong&gt;) but here’s what it’s all about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-elevator-pitch&quot;&gt;The elevator pitch&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is a strategic-shooter about tracking down an adversary across the multiverse. The player has to find and choose the right gear to complete his task. The world is lifeless, hostile and full of surprises. The view is from a third-person perspective and with a 3D environment created with procedural art on acid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a story-driven game but there will be a minimalist narrative through the setting and the characters. The focus will be on a short experience with a lot of replayability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-me&quot;&gt;About me&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Jérôme Viens Brie (AKA Capitaine Star) and I’ve been making games for almost 6 years now. Most of my time as been spent on AAA titles at Ubisoft Quebec (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeromebrie.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;check out the stuff I worked on!&lt;/a&gt;). My last official job title has been “Assistant” Technical Art Director, which basically means that I make sure the game works fine by constantly nagging the programmers and preventing artists to do too much damage. I have an academic background in computer science AND Arts so that makes me some kind of jake-of-all-trades. With all those skills and experience, I’m sure &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/YcPrAh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;everything will be juuust fine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be developed, at least for the first year, in the small town of Kuujjuaq. Located more than 1200km from Quebec City, the town is only accessible by air or sea. Yes, I know, that’s a pretty crazy idea right?  That will make me, arguably, the most secluded game dev in the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-the-dev-blog&quot;&gt;About the Dev Blog&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I will update this blog at a (semi-)regular interval. There will be work-in-progress screenshots, updates on current status and probably a couple of stories about how I fucked up something. Most importantly, I will upload some builds from time to time to get some feedback. With a bit of luck, those will not be a complete buggy mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have the intention of creating some short tutorials to, you know, give back. The majority of the knowledge I currently have or will eventually acquire comes from online sources so it’s about damn time I contribute a little!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Hey look down! There’s a nifty section for comments!&lt;/p&gt;
